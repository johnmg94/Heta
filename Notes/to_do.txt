Need to finish the db_connect function and test it. 

Connect to postgres isn't working in back end

Haven't tested front end requests to the db

Need to make sure db connection is secure

Should  the db_connect function return the connection object? 
I think it should but it obviously can't return it to the front end.

It needs to be passed and handled correctly inside of the backend....

CONNECTION TO DB ISNT WORKING
